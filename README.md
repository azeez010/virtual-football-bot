# __Bet9ja Virtual football bot__
Bet9ja virtual football bot for a client written with python and selenium framework. I used AWS SES (A cheap mail server from AWS) for sending scheduled e-mails in the application.

## How to run the application
* Install python on your device
* RUN pip install selenium, pyinstaller, boto3 to install the required dependencies
* SET your ENV variables for AWS Email Support
* Test the application by running python __virtual_league.py__, 
* if it runs well use __pyinstaller__ to turn the application into an executable file for windows.
