# __Bet9ja Virtual football bot__
Bet9ja virtual football bot for a client written with python and selenium framework. I used AWS SES (A cheap mail server from AWS) for sending scheduled e-mails in the application.

* To run install python
* RUN pip install selenium, boto3, pyinstaller
* SET your ENV variables for AWS Email Support
* Test, if running well use pyinstaller to turn the application into an executable file

I freelance at the moment, if you need anyhelp, send me a mail -> _dataslid@gmail.com_
